## About project.

Each of us has had a situation when we want to know more about our favorite artist than you know.
When, after listening to music for a while, you are filled with *inspiration* and begin to be
interested in everything that is happening in this area.

In my bot, you can use the search for the latest songs of your favorite artist,
take a look at the top charts of Genius, read the lyrics of the necessary compositions.

It's compatible with Python versions **3.7+**.

## Donating.

Occasionally we are asked if we accept donations to support the development. While we appreciate the thought,
maintaining PTB is our hobby, and we have almost no running costs for it. We therefore have nothing set up to accept donations. 
If you still want to donate, we kindly ask you to donate to another open source project/initiative of your choice instead.
